# 🌡️ ThermoStation ESP32

## 📋 Description  
**ThermoStation** is a basic weather station project that reads temperature and humidity in real time using a **DHT22** sensor. It runs on an **ESP32** chip and is developed using the **Arduino IDE**.

The project is still in an early stage, so this README will be improved with more detailed documentation once development progresses.

## ⚠️ Current Status  
🚧 **Project under active development**  
The basic sensor functionality works correctly, but there are currently issues with the web interface due to conflicts with the **ESPAsyncWebServer** library. The ESP32 reads sensor data without problems, but the web server is not responding properly.
