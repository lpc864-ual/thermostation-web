🌡️ ThermoStation ESP32

📋 Description
ThermoStation is a basic weather station project that reads temperature and humidity in real time using a DHT22 sensor. It runs on an ESP32 chip.

⚠️ Current Status
🚧 Project under active development
The basic sensor functionality works correctly, but there are currently issues with the web interface due to conflicts with the ESPAsyncWebServer library. The ESP32 reads sensor data without problems, but the web server is not responding properly.
